Project 2

Project title: Predicting Annual Salary with Linear Regression<br/><br/>

Description: One of big chellenges of graduating students is unsuring how to negotiate salary, and what they suppose to expected their salary. The purpose of this project is to create a linear regression model to provide expected salary for people who is pursuing a career in data science.<br/><br/>

Data:  I collected all the data from indeed.com(Web Scraping), including total 950 observations and 12 variables.<br/><br/>

Tool Used: Beautiful Soup, Selenium, Seaborn,matplotlib, Pandas, Numpy, scikit-learn<br/><br/>

Target Variable: Annual Salary<br/>

Features Variable: <br/>
  - Job title

  - Salary Satisfication rate %
  - Company overview rate on indeed
  - Company Benefit rate
  - Company headquarter location in state
  - Interview difficulty (Easy/Midium/Hard)
  - Interview process length <br/><br/>
